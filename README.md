Hey dude, Looking for my machine learning steps .Here you can see how I started writing codes on machine learning either with basic modules or writing them from scratch.
Just go through the skeleton codes and you will find each code absolutely good.
Also note that depending on where you save the dataset (link to dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T_7L_8-MIoCcLZJzHRU8stHrF1rdUTL7) in your local machine, you might have to change the path variable in the skeleton code.
